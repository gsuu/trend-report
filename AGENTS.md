## Newsletter Approval Flow

When the user provides a PDF, asks to collect source material, and then asks to send the newsletter:

1. Build the report and magazine site from the collected material.
2. Upload the magazine site to `/cttd-email/magazine` on the configured FTP server.
3. Use `https://email.cttd.co.kr/magazine` as `MAGAZINE_BASE_URL`.
4. Send the first test email only to `jisuk@cttd.co.kr`.
5. Wait for the user's explicit confirmation that the test email is okay.
6. After confirmation, send the final email to `cxd@cttd.co.kr`.

Do not send directly to `cxd@cttd.co.kr` before the test email has been confirmed.
